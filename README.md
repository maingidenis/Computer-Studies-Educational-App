# Computer-Studies-Educational-App

This is a simple computer studies app as the last project on the Andela Learning Community Nanodegree program. This app quizzes the user and gives scores depending on the correct answers. It also sends the correct answers to the user via Email. It displays the score and the name on via a Toast Message. The app also allows for the user to only click the submit button once they have answered more than three questions, which is disabled after submission.
